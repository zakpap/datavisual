## Google Trends Data Visual

Google is the most used search engine in the world. People use Google in the privacy of their own home or personal space. Searches might sort of anonymous, Google still publishes the numbers and searches done globally. I want to visualize the unexpected and strange results.

What are people Googling that they don't want others to see?

- illegal
- shameful
	bed wetting
	erection problem
	vaginal infection
	hemroid
	suicide
	std
	overweight
	depression
	closedted homosexuality
	

specific topics can be seen in countries, provinces and even cities
I would like to take results from the netherlands.
